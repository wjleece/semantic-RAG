Reduced spending by advertisers, \\na loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to \\ncustomize ads could harm our business.\\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023.

Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy \\npractices, such as our initiatives related to third-party cookies, including our recent announcement to move from \\nphasing out all third-party cookies to a proposed user choice model (which remains subject to continuing \\ndiscussions with regulators), as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have \\nin the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have \\nbeen developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some \\nproviders of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and \\nfunctionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively \\nand competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results.\\nITEM 2.

RISK FACTORS     \\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in \\nPart I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , as \\nupdated in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 , which could adversely affect \\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our stock. Below are \\nmaterial changes to our risk factors since our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 .\\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, \\na loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to \\ncustomize ads could harm our business.\\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, \\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more \\nvalue (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more \\neffective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy \\npractices, such as our initiatives related to third-party cookies, including our recent announcement to move from \\nphasing out all third-party cookies to a proposed user choice model (which remains subject to continuing \\ndiscussions with regulators), as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have \\nin the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have \\nbeen developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some \\nproviders of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and \\nfunctionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively \\nand competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results.\\nITEM 2.
